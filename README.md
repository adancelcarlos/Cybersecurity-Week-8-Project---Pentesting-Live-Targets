# Cybersecurity Week 9 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Session Hijacking/Fixation
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Username Enumeration
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)


Each color is vulnerable to only 2 of the 6 possible exploits. First discover which color has the specific vulnerability, then write a short description of how to exploit it, and finally demonstrate it using screenshots compiled into a GIF.

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: Session Hijacking

Use another browser which was NOT logged in and change the PHPSESSIONID we got from the previous browser.
It will show that it was automatically logged into the system in the browser without entering the password and username.
